Right now this tool is one file per operation, but it
would be better to be able to feed in a list of files.

We could process them in parallel to determine text or
binary, and perform the appropriate operation on them.

Can still keep single file modes for manual operations
or testing, but since the parent build should be able
to feed us all the files at once it would simplify the
parent build logic to be able to just hand us the list
and take care of it.  Should also speed things up a lot
since parallel processing ought to be an option.
